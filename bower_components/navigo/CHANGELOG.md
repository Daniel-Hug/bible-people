## 4.0.0

That's a minor but a breaking change. The `generate` method now outputs proper strings base on the `useHash` parameter. Or in other words if the router is using hash based routing the generated URLs contain `#` in the beginning.

## 3.5.1

* Proper initialization of the root when using `useHash = true`
* Minor fix while resolving hash based URLs (for Firefox)

## 3.5.0

* Adding a `resume` method which is same as `.pause(false)`. `.pause` now acts as `.pause(true)` by default.

## 3.4.2

* Fixing [#63](https://github.com/krasimir/navigo/issues/63/).

## 3.4.1

* Support of hooks in named routes. ([#60](https://github.com/krasimir/navigo/issues/60))

## 3.4.0

* Merging [#58](https://github.com/krasimir/navigo/pull/58) where we can prevent the handler calling from a before hook.

## 3.3.3

* Another try fixing [#57](https://github.com/krasimir/navigo/issues/57) - now if we have `noHash=false` the hash part of the URL is removed and we are no longer considering it while comparing the last resolved URL.

## 3.3.2

* Fixing [#57](https://github.com/krasimir/navigo/issues/57) - making sure that we keep the last resolved url when we have the `notFound` handler resolves.

## 3.3.1

* Fixing [#56](https://github.com/krasimir/navigo/issues/56) - When a `/` is given as a path it is considered as a default route handler.

## 3.3.0

* Start using [`onhaschange`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/API/WindowEventHandlers/onhashchange) API as a default for hash based routing.
* Using [karma](https://www.npmjs.com/package/karma) as a test runner.

## 3.2.1

* Fixing the case where route handlers are not fired when only the query string part of the URL is changed (#53)

## 3.2.0

* [Accessing GET parameters](https://github.com/krasimir/navigo#accessing-get-parameters).

## 3.1.0

* [hooks](https://github.com/krasimir/navigo#hooks) support.
